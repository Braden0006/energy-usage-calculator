# Energy usage calculator
This application is intended to combine IoT development with full-stack development. This applicaiton will perform similarly to something like Rocky Mountain Power, where energy usage will be calculated from my house and displayed in a dashboard. 
There will be features such as creating and managing an account, the option to delete your account, enter devices that you are using in your home, an admin dashboard for viewing additional information on users accounts, and more.

The technologies used so far are:
* Spring Boot
* Thymeleaf
